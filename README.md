# Civ7_Colors
## Description
This repo contains a Python script that allows users to edit the main colors of leaders in the video game Sid Meier's Civilization VII. The mod currently supports base-game leaders, no DLC content.

> It is important to note that this code edits the Civilization VII source code directly, namely the following files: `playerstandardcolors.xml` and `playercolors.xml`. **This program lets you safely undo any changes to regain the original source code**.

## Installation
### Windows
1. Download the ZIP file of this repository by either clicking [here](https://github.com/NoleStites/Civ7_Colors/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clicking the big green "<> Code" button at the top of the page and selecting "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file by right-clicking it in your Downloads folder and selecting "Extract"
3. Enter the new folder and double-click the `main.py` file to start the program

> Windows 11 should come with Python installed by default. If it isn't installed already, install it through the Microsoft Store. 

### Linux
Coming soon.
