# Civ7_Colors
## Description
This repo contains a Python script that allows users to edit the main colors of leaders in the video game Sid Meier's Civilization VII. The mod currently supports base-game leaders, no DLC content.

> It is important to note that this code edits the Civilization VII source code directly, namely the following files: `playerstandardcolors.xml` and `playercolors.xml`. **This program lets you safely undo any changes to regain the original source code**.
